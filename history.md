Add Independent GQRL concept, following the idea of some distributed swarm reinforcement learning approaches

Fixing the time problems, seems that the algorithms reach a stable sub-optimal policy.
 * Initial configuration ![image](result/19-11-20/concentrated_episode-0..png)
 * Final configuration ![image](result/19-11-20/concentrated_episode-20..png)
This result is reached using ConcentratedProgramRL using the task *concentratedGRL*
This is a sub-optimail solution, but finally the aggregate converge to a policy:

 * [*Q-table learn]()
